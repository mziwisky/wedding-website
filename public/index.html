            The ceremony will be outdoors, requiring a short walk across a path of dirt and woodchips. Consider this a word of caution to guests considering high heels -- if the earth is particularly soft on July 30, you may be perforating it.

          <h5>OUR STORY</h5>

          <div id="story">
            This story started a little over 4 years ago at Marquette University
            in Milwaukee, WI. Michael was pursuing his masters degree in
            engineering and I was pursuing mine in physician assistant studies.
            His engineering lab was located in Cudahy Hall on the same floor I
            liked to study on.  He approached me one day while I was studying and
            we had a nice chat. I remember he gave me an organic apple he had
            bought from a farmer's market. Anybody who knows me knows I'm a bit
            of a health nut so with a local, organic offering, he was off to a
            good start. In the coming weeks, I made a point to study more at
            Cudahy Hall than at home or in the library. And he made a point to
            come sit down and chat with me. One thing led to another and some
            study dates led to yoga dates led to a metal concert (yes, that's
            right. I was trying to show him how open and cool I was going to a
            metal concert with him) led to a blossoming love that is as strong as
            ever. I'll leave it at that. Oh wait, actually I'll leave it with one
            of my favorite Walt Whitman quotes, "We were together. I forget the
            rest."
